# itch.io app

**This project is in very early development!**

The itch.io app is a cross-platform client for the [itch.io][1] marketplace. It is built with the
Qt 5 framework and is currently available for Windows, Linux and OS X.


## Building the client

Firstly, clone the project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/leafo/itchio-app.git
```

To compile and run the project, you can open the `itchio.pro` file from [Qt Creator][2] and click run.
The build procedure can also be performed from the command line via the following commands:
```bash
$ cd itchio-app
$ make
$ ./build/itchio
```

For more information on the available `make` targets, please read the provided help page
```bash
$ make help
```


## Coding style

`astyle` is used to format the codebase. The 1TBS preset is used. To format all
source files run:
```bash
$ make format
```
